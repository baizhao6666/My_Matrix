# My_Matrix

In this project, we were required to implement matrix calculation in C++

We were implementing in a user-defined class called mymatrix.h(starter code provided by Dr. Adam Koehler)

The matrix calculation include scalar multiplication and matrix multiplication by operator overloaded

We can also grow the matrix by different sizes
